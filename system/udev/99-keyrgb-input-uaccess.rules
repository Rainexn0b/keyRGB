# Allow active local user session to read keyboard input events for reactive effects.
#
# SECURITY WARNING:
#   Access to /dev/input/event* allows observing keypresses. This rule uses
#   seat-based ACLs (uaccess) so only the active local desktop user gets access.
#
# On some distros, input devices do not get uaccess by default; without this,
# reactive typing effects may fall back to a synthetic animation.
