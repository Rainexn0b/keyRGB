# Code of Conduct

KeyRGB is an open source project. We want a friendly, productive community.

## Expectations

- Be respectful and constructive.
- Assume good intent and ask clarifying questions.
- Focus feedback on ideas, code, and behavior — not people.
- Avoid harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks.

## Scope

This applies to project spaces (issues, pull requests, discussions) and any community channels used for KeyRGB collaboration.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers may remove, edit, or reject content that violates these expectations, and may restrict participation for repeated or severe violations.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness problematic behavior, open an issue if you’re comfortable doing so. If you prefer private reporting, contact the maintainer via the email or handle listed in the repository’s GitHub profile.
